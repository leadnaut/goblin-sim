# goblin-dreams

This project is an attempt to create a procedural goblin fantasy world generator and simulator. By simulating the lives of individual goblins, hopefully a rich and detailed history of the world can be generated super super slowly.

Files:

- goblins.py - main runtime file
- world.py - world class and generation
- tools.py - general analysis and visualisation tools
- data.py - config data storage
